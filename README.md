Deep Learning in the Browser
============================

I experimented with some frameworks used to deploy ML models in the browser. I made a webapp to load and classify images in Tensorflow.js, WebDNN and ONNX.js and compared
their runtime with different backends (WebGL, WASM, CPU). 

I also wrote a blog post on this which can serve as a tutorial along with this code - [Blogpost](

Requirements
============

* Node.js (v12+)
* Express

The rest of the JS libraries and models are included in this repository.
